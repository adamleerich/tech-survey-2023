The term Deep Learning is so ambiguous as to be worthless in a survey. You should explicitly mention Neural Networks too. Also, time series and/or Linear Models have a wide range of potential models and being specific would help in generating a useful survey.  For example, you could mention General Additive Models as a subcategory of GLMs or include a general statement about penalized regression which I think is the most promising path to linking credibility concepts to GLMs for class plan work that I have seen in recent times. ","Asking what technology that you believe should be included on the CAS basic education syllabus, the depth at which it should be covered on the exams and how it should be tested would have been worthwhile.  Asking which online courses that you have found worthwhile would be an interesting source of information for possible future syllabus content. ","I have seen the CAS advertisements for our home-grown programming courses. It would be much more cost efficient for our members to take commercial online courses like those offered through COURSERA.
